# Secondary sampling unity {#sec-ssu}

- For each selected hexagon, a grid of small hexagons spaced of 294 meters are create to perform the secondary sampling (SSU).
- For each SSU hexagon within the SSU, habitat pixels are extract to compute a new layer of habitat inclusion probability following the same approach used for the PSU.
- A SSU is defined as available given the following rules:
    - Must have 6 neighbours (less than that means it's a border SSU)
    - Must have at least 1 - `prop_na` of non empty pixels
    - 4 out 6 neighbours must also respect the above rule
