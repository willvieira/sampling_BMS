# Sample size

- Sample effort for an ecoregion is defined to 2% of available hexagons
- Hexagons within an ecoregions need at least 20% of its area to be covered in natural habitats
- Specify that all ecoregions has to have at least 2 hexagons to be sampled

In practice for computation efficiency, we did not work with the area to compute the sample size, but the number of hexagons in which the centroid fell into the buffer.
