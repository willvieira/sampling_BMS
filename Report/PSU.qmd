# Primary sampling unity {#sec-psu}

- The stratified selection of hexagons (PSUs) is performed using the GRTS algorithm.

## User defined parameters

The user has to define some parameters when running the GRTS such as:
- List of ecoregions to sample
- Sample effort
- Number of replications
- A csv file with at least latitude and longitude information for each legacy site
- The folder to save the selected hexagons


## GRTS

- The GRTS samples hexagons for N replication times.
- The cheapest replication is selected.
- Once the main hexagons are selected by the GRTS, we manually select an available neighbour hexagon with the highest inclusion probability.
