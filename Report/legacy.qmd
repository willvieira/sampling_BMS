# Legacy sites

- Describe legacy sites
- Map of legacy sites
- Count number of legacy sites per hexagon
- Cite the simulations in Apendix X where we define the best values of buffer size to reduce inclusion probability and adjust sample size

## Inclusion probability

- Inclusion probability of each hexagon is adjust given a buffer around legacy sites using the R package `MBHdesign` [@Foster2021].

## Sample size

- Sample size of an ecoregion is ajusted given a buffer around the legacy sites present in the ecoregion.
